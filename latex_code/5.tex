\subsection{Two level factorial design}

We suppose we have $k$ main factors $x_1,\dots,x_k$ making up a model of the form:
$$
    \Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1\x_1+\dots+\beta_k\x_k + \epsilon, \quad \epsilon\sim N(0, \sigma^2).
$$ 
Further we suppose a feature matrix $\X$ satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each column has entries $\pm 1$.
    \item The colomns are orthogonal, i.e. $\bf{1}^T\x_i=\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij}=0$ and $\x_iT\x_j=n\delta_{ij}$. 
\end{enumerate}

This in particular implies that we have $\X^T \X = n I_n$. Using results from regression analysis, this significantly simplifies our estimators:

\TODO{expressions}

\begin{definition}
    The \term{main effect} of main factor $j$ is defined as:
    $$
        \textrm{effect}_j = \textrm{response at high level} - \textrm{response at low level} = 2\beta_j.
    $$
\end{definition}
The estimated effect is naturally
$$
    \widehat{\textrm{effect}_j} = \textrm{estimated response at high level} - \textrm{estimated response at low level} = 2\bh_j.
$$
To go from this to a $2^k$-design, we take into account interactions of the factors modelled as products of main factors:
$$
    Y = \b_0 + \b_1x_1+\dots+\b_kx_k + \b_{1,2}x_1x_2 + \dots+\b_{k-1,k}x_{k-1}k_{k}+\dots+\b_{1,2,\dots,k}x_1\cdots x_k.
$$
We extend the design matrix accordingly, and note that we still satisfy the assumptions. 

\TODO{example ?}

\subsubsection{Inference about effect}

Need inference about $\s^2$... cannot use estimator from multiple linear regression since for MLR we have $\sh^2=\frac{\textrm{SSE}}{n-p}$ and here $n=p$. We have to resort to one of two methods.

1. neglect some effects ... then these are normally dist ... use these as estimator \dots

2. Lenth's method ...
