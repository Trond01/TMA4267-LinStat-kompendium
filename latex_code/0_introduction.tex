
This is a brief summary of the course TMA4267 about linear statistical models. It includes the main content from the lecture held by ... recorded in, where some examples etc... are excluded. 

The purpose of the notes is to give a good overview of the syllabus. I intend to add summaries of the lectures as I review them. I hope to include insights from projects / exercises where it is appropriate.
