Suppose $k$ covariates. Then $2^k$ possible models from maximal:
$$
    Y_i = \b_0+\b_1x_{i1} + \dots + \b_kx_{ik}.
$$
to minimal:
$$
    Y_i = \b_0.
$$
We want to arrive at a compromise between simplisity and goodness of fit. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Adjusted coefficient of determination:
    $$
        R^2_{\mr{adj}} = 1 - \frac{\mr{SSE} / (n-k-1)}{\mr{SST} / (n-1)}
    $$
